    <p id="collapseTwo" class="collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingTwo">>After graduating from my Masters, I decided to take some time out and travel Asia. I moved to Korea, where I taught English at first. While I was doing this I had a scooter accident, which made me realise that life is short and I should appreciate every day I have. I made an effort to get into jobs that I would wake up in the morning and look forward to going in to do, first at advertising agencies, then went on to do some modelling, TV work and play bass guitar in a band. I then decided to return to London and after a year back started experimenting with coding and ruby on the advice of many of my close friends, who described me as a "massive geek who just didn't know it yet". I realised it was something that I really enjoyed and that I wanted to do everyday so took steps to make this part of my life and work with my courses at General Assembly.</p>

          "Coding all day every day!"
          After enjoying General Assembly's Front End course I wanted a more involved course that would help me switch careers. I really enjoyed learning how to build sites and apps from the back to the front. I am looking forward to applying what I have learnt to my daily life and work.
          <br>
          I learnt a variety of coding languages, with focus on Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Some of the languages and frameworks covered include SQL, Sinatra, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Canvas, JQuery, Ajax, Angular.js, Node.js, CSS/SCSS, HTML/HAML and Git regularly. <br>
          We practiced an AGILE environment for our work, using Trello to organise group work.
