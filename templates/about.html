  <h1 class="text-center"><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i>About</h1>

  <p>After graduating from my Masters, I decided to take some time out and travel Asia. I moved to Korea, where I taught English at first. While I was doing this I had a scooter accident, which made me realise that life is short and I should appreciate every day I have. I made an effort to get into jobs that I would wake up in the morning and look forward to going in to do, first at advertising agencies, then went on to do some modelling, TV work and play bass guitar in a band. I then decided to return to London and after a year back started experimenting with coding and ruby on the advice of many of my close friends, who described me as a "massive geek who just didn't know it yet". I realised it was something that I really enjoyed and that I wanted to do everyday so took steps to make this part of my life and work with my courses at General Assembly.</p>
